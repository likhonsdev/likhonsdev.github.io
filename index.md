# About Me

A passionate developer with expertise in web development, blockchain technology, and ethical hacking.

## Background

I'm Likhon Sheikh, a multifaceted developer from Bangladesh with a global perspective. Currently based in Austin, Texas, I blend my commerce education with technical expertise to create innovative solutions across various domains.

I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours) in Accounting while actively developing my skills in web development, blockchain technology, and cybersecurity.

## Professional Journey

My journey began as a frontend developer working with HTML and CSS. I've since expanded my expertise to full-stack development, blockchain solutions, and smart contract security.

I'm a key contributor to the Rekt Developer team, where we specialize in DeFi protocol development and smart contract auditing. Our team has audited 75+ contracts and identified 350+ vulnerabilities, helping secure the blockchain ecosystem.
